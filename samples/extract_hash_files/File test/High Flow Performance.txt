1. Exercise as Stimulus
* Combining Strength & Hypertrophy
- Strength -> How much weight can be lifted
- Strength is specific to each exercise
- Trainees must practice the lift they want to get stronger at
- Implement the exercise you want to get stronger at:
+ Use top sets for strength & back-off sets + accessory lift for hypertrophy
+ Strength & hypertrophy are highly compatible
+ Hypertrophy training increase muscle size
+ Strength training increase neural efficiency

2. Complete Programming and Periodization for Maximum Strength | How to Write a Strength Program
VD: Back Squat
- 20 weeks -> 4 block -> 5 weeks/1 block:
+ Block 1 (W1 - W5): 6 - 10 reps
+ Block 2 (W6 - W10): 4 - 8 reps
+ Block 3 (W11 - W15): 2 - 6 reps
+ Block 4 (W16 - W20): 1 - 4 reps
- Intensity recommendations:
+ Further from peak: lighter loads
+ Closer to peak: heavier loads
- Volume recommendations:
+ Hypertrophy emphasis: higher volume
+ Neural efficiency: lower volume
- Accumulation progression: Increase volume, maintain intensity
- Intensification progression: Increase strength, maintain volume
- Realisation progression: Increase intensity, decreasing volume
- Role of assistance exercises:
+ More volume for primary muscles = more muscle growth
- Assistance exercises recommendations:
+ Joint friendly
+ 8+ reps
+ No specific movement pattern
+ Hypertrophy progression

3. How important are 'Effective reps' for muscle growth?
* What are 'effective rep'?
- Last few reps of a set are what stimulates muscle growth
- Reps performed earlier in the set do little/ nothing for muscle growth
- Typically, the last 5 reps are considered the 'effective reps'
* Proximity to failure
- Training closer to failure usually results in greater muscle growth
* Volume vs Intensity
- Effective reps model would predict intensity to be more important than volume
- Fewer set closer to failure -> more sets further from failure
* Rest periods:
- Longer rest periods allow superior lifting performance on subsequent sets
- Shorter rest periods still accumulate just as many 'effective reps'
- Even when 'effective reps' are equated, longer rest periods produce greater growth
* Rep range:
- Light (> 15 RM) / Moderate (9-15 RM) / Heavy (<= 8 RM)
- Lighter Loads: 
+ More important to train closer to failure
+ 'Effective reps' don't start until the muscle is highly fatigued
- Heavy loads: 
+ Less benefit for training very close to failure
+ Already closer to failure from the beginning of the set
* Metabolite techniques:
- Drop sets:
+ Drop sets are effective for building muscle
+ Doesn't significantly inhibit the hypertrophic stimulus
- Rest-pause/ myo reps:
+ Performing reps closer to failure seems to be more hypertrophic
+ Supports the effective reps model
- Pre-fatigue
* Practical recommendations:
- Training closer to failure results in superior growth
- Reps closer to failure might be more hypertrophic than reps further from failure:
+ More important when training with lighter loads & higher rep ranges
------
4. Surplus for muscle growth?
- A surplus is not mandatory for muscle growth
- Hypertrophy can occur at maintenance or a calorie deficit
- A surplus is probably required to maximise muscle growth
- Surplus: 250-500 kcal/day
------
5. Deficit for fat loss
- A calorie deficit is required for significant fat loss
- Aim to lose weight while preserving muscle mass
------
6. Rate of weight loss
- Slower weight loss may promote greater muscle retention
- Faster weight loss allows us to enter maintenance/surplus sooner
------
7. Fat loss guide
- Weight loss is not the ultimate goal
- Fat loss is the ultimate goal
* Nutrition vs Training:
- Nutrition & Training are both required to maximise fat loss
- Both are important to change body composition
* Rate of weight loss:
- Slower weight loss is generally more sustainable
* Protein intake:
- Influences muscle growth/retention
- Increase protein intakes are generally superior
- Protein intake can help with muscle retention during a calorie deficit
- Protein intake doesn't stimulate muscle growth
- Resistance training stimulate muscle growth
- Protein intake can assist the muscle growth response
- A high protein intake during a deficit can promote muscle growth/retention
- Aim to consume at least 1.5g / kg / day
* Resistance training:
- Provides the stimulus for muscle hypertrophy
* Type of resistance training
- Focus on hypertrophy-style training:
+ Will help retain as much muscle as possible
+ 6 - 20 rep range
+ High Volume 
+ Close proximity to failure
* Cardio/Physical activity
- Contributes to greater overall energy expenditure
- Not the primary contributor to a calorie deficit (can assist the calorie deficit)
- Can be quantified using daily step counts
- At least ~7500 steps per day
- More physical activity will be additionally beneficial
- > 15000 steps may not be worth the time & energy
* How much physical activity:
- Step count: 0 - 5000 (Low)
- Step count: 5000 - 10000 (Moderate)
- Step count: 10000 - 15000 (High)
- Step count: 15000+ (Very High)
* Practical recommendations
- Fat loss:
+ Weight loss
+ Muscle growth/retention
- Nutritional Strategies:
+ Calorie deficit
+ High protein intake
- Training strategies:
+ Hypertrophy-focussed resistance training
+ Moderate-high physical activity level
------
8. How to reduce calorie intake without tracking
* Energy balance
- Reducing calorie intake has a more direct effect on ergy balance
- Increasing exercise has less direct effect on energy balance
* Bodyweight tracking
- Increase satiety from high-volume foods:
+ Include fruit & vegetables in each meals
- Protein intake:
- High protein diets are usually more satiating
- Likely due to increase satiety & decrease hunger
- Consume a minimum of ~1.5g/kg/day
* Intuitive/mindful eating
- Using inherent hunger/satiety signals to regulate eating behavior:
+ Only eat when you are hungry
+ Eat until you are satiated but not overly full
+ Helps us eat based on actual energy needs
* Exercise:
- Exercise helps regulate hunger & satiety signals:
+ High physical activity levels help us feel more satieted after eating & less hungry throughout the day
+ Includes weight-training & all other forms of movement

9. Methods of progressing hypertrophy training / Sets, Reps & RPE
- Progressive overload for muscle hypertrophy
+ More reps
+ More sets
+ More weight
- Method 1: Increasing Sets => Next mesocycle: increase reps; increase load
- Method 2: Increasing Reps (repeat for 2-3 mesocycles or until plateaued) => Increase Load; change exercise
- When plateaued => Change Load; Change exercise
------
10. Method of progressing hypertrophy training | from week to week
- Increasing reps:
+ Maintain sets and load
+ Increase total number of reps performed per exercise
- Increasing volume:
+ Increase volume by 1-2 sets per muscle group, per week
+ Increase amount of stimulus each muscle group receives
------
11. Complete exercise selection for hypertrophy training
- No mandatory exercises for hypertrophy training
- Aim to increase stimulus & decrease fatigue
